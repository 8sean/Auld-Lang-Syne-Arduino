# Auld-Lang-Syne-Arduino
The classic Auld Lang Syne or UVA's Good Ole Song on the Arduino UNO using tone() with the piezo buzzer.

Follow https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/digital/toneMelody/ to set up the piezo buzzer.
Once that is setup, paste the code in, and enjoy!

Here is the setup on TinkerCAD https://www.tinkercad.com/things/hGb5LrEpG2f-uva-good-ole-song?sharecode=irMInpGepoENFECPfgctMhxa82BZ05ynRl2ql6FU2nk

Credit to https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs for parts of the for loop that runs the tone().
Other than that, the sketch was written by myself and based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzTFwVTDg2I for the Auld Lang Syne notes, so credit to them.
